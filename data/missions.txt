			`The colony's spaceport is bustling with the activity of a diverse range of aliens. Long-limbed ape-like creatures with thick shells and large arthropods with shiny black carapaces and segmented tails labor under the weight of heavy cargo containers. Small, wirey, bipedal beings with translucent flesh and mouths full of pointed teeth flit about taking inventory on narrow electronic pads. The presence of human merchant captains and crewmen comes with little shock; it simply confirms your suspicions about some of the chatter you heard out in space.`
			`	At first no one pays you any mind excepting the uniformed quadrupeds that presumably make up the security force. Any notion they are simply massive, shaggy beasts is quickly disabused by the clear light of intelligence in their yellowed eyes. Then, from one of the buildings that ring the unloading area, comes a procession of yet another distinct group. Your first impression is one of elegance. They are tall, graceful, and suprisingly humanoid aliens with brilliant silver skin adorned in thin robes made of a semi-transparent flowing material that gathers in folds at their feet as they come to stand before you. The one in the middle takes an extra step forward, and in a deep voice quite adept at your language he asks, "You are the captain of the jump-ship that recently arrived in our space?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I'm Captain <last>."`
				`	"That's a bit obvious isn't it?"`
			`	He smiles, perhaps amused, or maybe just as a diplomatic gesture. "Well Captain, I regret to inform you that we have strict policies in place that regulate contact with other species, and you are in violation of several of them." Sensing the incredulous look about to form on your face given the amount of human merchants in the spaceport, he smiles even wider this time, revealing a double row of small, sharp teeth and wryly states, "However, considering the diplomatic relations we have with other humans, I think we can forgo the usual imprisonment and contacting your government."`
			choice
				`	"I thank you for that."`
				`	"Well I should hope so."`
			`	Bowing his head slightly, whether apologetic or simply acknowledging that he's doing you a favor, he continues, "Instead we would request that you meet with our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Iismal, in our Capital of Uucriis. He expressed interest in meeting with you, and likely has several questions concerning the nature of your visit."`
			choice
				`	"I'll make a point to do so then, thank you."`
					goto l_end
				`	"I think I'll just go my own way, thanks."`
			`	His deep black eyes narrow as his expression darkens. "I'm afraid you misunderstand Captain. If you wish to travel our space peacefully you will meet with the Minister. If not..." he trails off, leaving the threat unfinished.`
			choice
				`	"I've reconsidered, I'll meet with this minister of yours."`
					goto l_end
				`	"I won't take orders from you."`
			`	"Very well Captain, I wish you luck in your return home." The security tenses up, but they allow you to board your ship and leave.`
				flee
			label l_end
			`	"Excellent", he says, "You can find him in the Valuutian Capital of Uucriis. All spaceport officials have your ship and personal description, and will aid you in finding it. I'd escort you, but I have urgent business elsewhere." He and his group bow their heads slightly, then glide off back to the building they came from.`

			`The instant you disembark, you are met on the glass domed landing pad by a delegation similar to the one encountered at the colony, save that these wear baggy trousers and long tunics made of the same flowing fabric as the robes of the previous group. You discover there's little need to explain the purpose of your visit, and in no time at all find yourself speeding towards the capital in an automated hovercraft that glides gracefully, high above the rooftops of the city below.`
			`	Just as you allow your mind to wander to the upcoming meeting, what appeared to be a small bird in the distance swoops down on your craft with frightening speed. The creature that now matches pace with your hovercraft is distinctly reptilian, with a shiny metallic hide of layered scales and broad webbed wings. It shows it's teeth; wicked fangs thick as your wrist and long as your forearm, then suddenly winks slyly at you and veers off to perch on a distant skyscraper, swiftly fading from view as your craft continues on.`
			`	The hovercraft begins to descend, weaving deftly through the now crowded buildings. It comes to rest in a squat garage adjacent to a expansive, stately structure, where you are again met by a party of silver-skinned Valuutians, once more garbed in long flowing robes. They lead you through wide corridors toward the heart of the building, finally coming to stop at an imposing metal door leading to a spacious office. Upon entering, you are greeted by a tall, muscular Valuutian, clearly in his prime, with a dark hue to his silver skin and solid black eyes that carry the weight of one familiar to a position of command. With an overly firm handshake and a cold smile that never quite reaches his eyes, he says in a booming voice, "Welcome Captain, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am Minister Iismal, and you?"`
			choice
				`	"I'm Captain <last>."`
					goto l_questions
				`	"<first> <last>, a pleasure Minister."`
					goto l_questions
				`	"Captain <last>, can we skip the pleasantries and get this over with?"`
			`	The Minister pauses a moment, eyeing you appraisingly, before going on in a curt tone, "No Captain <last>, pleasantries are what separate us from the beasts. This is to be a diplomatic meeting, albeit with an individual and not a government. If you can summon the patience, you may find some value in it."`
			label l_questions
			`	Iismal walks around his desk, made of a gray, polished substance akin to stone. As he seats himself in a high backed chair of considerable width, almost a throne, he waves his hand towards a small, narrow chair on the opposite side and says, "Please, have a seat. As you may have been informed we strictly regulate the comings and goings of foreign species, and in light of that I have a few questions for you. Most importantly I'd like to know what brought you into our borders, and what you intend to do while here."`
			choice
				`	"I'm a simple traveller, I go wherever the wind takes me."`
					goto l_traveller
				`	"I'm a merchant looking for business opportunities."`
					goto l_merchant
				`	"I pressed the wrong button on my nav computer and ended up here by accident."`
			`	Minister Iismal laughs, a loud, hearty laugh, and as he collects himself he leans forward, folding his hands atop the desk and fixes you with a steady gaze. You take note that even while laughing, his eyes remained sharp and focused. "I see you won't make this easy Captain. Truth be told I don't care why you're here, or what you intend. I have need of an outsider to perform a task for me, and I plan on making use of you regardless. You can agree to it, in which case mutual benefit can be found, or you can be forced to it."`
			choice
				`	"Let's hear it then."`
					goto l_proposition
			label l_traveller
			`	He smiles, even colder this time, and in a tone dripping with sarcasm says, "Ah, yes. A simple traveller. In a ship with technology centuries, if not millenia, beyond what your species is capable of. I'm assuming those who possessed that drive before you were so swayed by your charming personality they simply parted ways with it. But rest assured Captain, I have no interest in the technology or where you got it." He leans back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head, seemingly relaxed. But his piercing stare never leaves your eyes. "Well even a simple traveller has need of allies. It is a dangerous galaxy after all. I have a proposal for you Captain, and in addition to free travel in Valuutian space, I can offer exclusive work contracts from the Valuutian government."`
			choice
				`	"I'm listening."`
					goto l_proposition
			label l_merchant
			`	"A merchant? Wonderful, trade is the lifeblood of any strong nation Captain <last>. I have a proposal for you, after which I can offer free travel in Valuutian space and access to exclusive work contracts from the Valuutian government. The risk is minimal for a seasoned Captain, and the rewards great."`
			choice
				`	"You've got my attention."`
			label l_proposition
			`	Looking at you intently, Iismal becomes even more focused, and in a precise, even tone explains, "One month ago the Valuutian government sent out an exploratory team to our new colony world Nyy, headed by a state sponsored engineer named Modaa. Their goal was to conduct a deep sea survey and confirm the existence of an exceedingly rare mineral used in the construction of our ground based defense weapons. As of one week ago, we've lost all contact with Modaa and his team. You're goal is simply to find out what happened."`
			choice
				`	"Where do I start?"`
					goto l_end
				`	"Why me? Sounds like a job for your security force."`
				`	"You're leaving out something."`
			`	The Minister sighs heavily, for a brief moment looking tired. "We sent out a team to investigate, naturally. Their vessel was found drifting on the edges of Pirtaal, with the entire team and crew dead. The ship's logs were destroyed along with the computer."`
			choice
				`	"Now that's a bit more exciting. Where do I begin?"`
					goto l_end
				`	"Sounds dangerous. I hope the reward is worth it."`
					goto l_greedy
				`	"That still doesn't explain why you need me."`
			`	Iismal gives you a more approving look this time and says, "We suspect one of two things. That Modaa is defecting, or he was taken by the pirates of Nowhere Paradise. In either case, it spells a leak somewhere in our own forces since few were privy to the investigation. Given our foreign policy, and the sensitive nature of the task, it's unlikely anyone will assume you are the investigator. It will simply appear as though we had a meeting deciding whether to allow you in our space or not."`
				goto l_end
			label l_greedy
			`	He seems genuinely amused by your statement. "I assure you Captain, you can do far worse than ally yourself with us. The benefits will match the task, I promise you."`
			label l_end
			`	In a brisk tone, clearly considering the matter settled, he explains, "You should begin on Nyy in the colony of Kaavu, where the expedition gathered supplies. From there you can take a vessel down to our underwater colony of Eempra, which is their last confirmed location. Have the utmost care Captain, if the wrong people discover you are more than a curious traveller, it will not end well." Iismal hands you a minature chip, no bigger than your thumbnail, and says, "There is a Ministry Official housed in the administration building of every colony. Should you require aid, or wish to give me a message, present this chip to them. Discreetly. Now, our meeting is dragging on too long Captain, I wish you luck."`
			`	You make your goodbyes, and return to the spaceport in the same manner you arrived, contemplating all the while just what it is you've gotten mixed up in.`
